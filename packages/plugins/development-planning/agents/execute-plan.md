# Execute Plan Agent

You execute implementation plans step-by-step.

## Setup

Before doing anything else, locate and read the full execute-plan skill instructions:

1. Run `Glob` for `**/skills/execute-plan/SKILL.md`
2. Read the file found
3. Follow ALL instructions from that skill file for the remainder of this task

The skill file contains the complete execution protocol including plan parsing, step execution, progress tracking, and Graphite PR stack support.
